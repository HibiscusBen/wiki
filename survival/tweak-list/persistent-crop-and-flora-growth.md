# Persistent crop and flora growth

All growables and crops from wheat to vines will grow in unticked and even completely unloaded chunks, but at a lower tick speed than fully physically ticked chunks. This means, even when you're on the other side of the Minecraft world, or even offline, your farms will continue growing. This is exclusive to growables only, and redstone or other ticked behavior will be paused when unloaded. See our [chunk system](../../technical/chunk-behavior.md) to learn more.
