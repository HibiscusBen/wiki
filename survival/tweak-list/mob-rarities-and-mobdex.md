# Mob rarities and mobdex

The mobdex is a collection of all the mob rarities you've discovered. You can discover mobs and add them to your mobdex by standing nearby them, right clicking them, or killing them. Rarer mobs are stronger and drop more xp. Note that once a mob is found by a player and added to their mobdex, the same mob can't be discovered again and added to other players mobdexes -- they will have to find another mob of the same rarity that hasn't been discovered by any players yet. Can you collect them all?
