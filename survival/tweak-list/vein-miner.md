# Vein miner

When mining ore veins, crouch to activate vein miner. Durability loss for each ore broken will apply to your item (unbreaking and looting is taken into account). If your pickaxe does not have enough durability to mine the whole vein, or you're not crouching, vein miner will not activate.
