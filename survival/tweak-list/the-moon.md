# The moon

You are able to travel to the moon by going up to Y 1,000 in the survival world. It's just a little chill hangout space! When you hop off you'll fall back down to where you flew up. Happy mooning üåù

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that as previous locations are stored in temporary memory, if you stay on the moon across a server restart or after being disconnected for a long time, when rejoining you'll fall back to spawn instead of where you initially entered.
