# Toggleable PvP

Each player can decide whether they want to enable PvP. When a player has PvP enabled they can damage and be damaged by others with PvP enabled. Note that even if a player has PvP enabled, you need their permission to engage in PvP.

By default, PvP is disabled but can be toggled on and off using **/pvptoggle**
