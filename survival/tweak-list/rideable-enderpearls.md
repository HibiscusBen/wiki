# Rideable enderpearls

When you throw an enderpearl you will automatically mount it and travel on its flight path. You may dismount at any time by pressing your shift key. You can repeatedly throw and dismount pearls to travel long distances quickly, being the next best thing to an elytra with rockets.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can crouch before throwing pearls to prevent riding and have them behave normally
