{% hint style="success" %}
We are happy to provide answers to any questions or concerns you have, no matter how small. If you find this page does not address a question or concern you have regarding seasons, please use the #contact-staff channel on our [Discord](../../general/discord.md) :)

## What's a season?

The SMP operates on a season based rotation. Based on community retention (roughly every 12 months) we completely refresh the smp, including all the smp worlds, skills, economy, inventories, community warps, etc. Our goal is to give sufficient time for everybody to reach end game and feel satisfied with their work, while also ensuring new content is always available for everyone in the future.

New seasons only affect the smp itself. Players member or vip ranks, server level, and content in creative plots & parkour are never reset in new seasons. **Play time is season based, so it will be reset!**

The smp is currently in its 8th season, which began June 13, 2025

## **What isn't reset?**

New seasons only affect the smp itself. Member or vip ranks, server level, profile information like your nickname, pronouns, preferences, etc. and content in creative plots and parkour are never reset in new seasons.

## **Why do we do seasons?**

Our number one goal is to keep everyone engaged and happy. We want to make sure you can continue to enjoy what you love doing and have the best experience on the server as possible. With that said, when a smp gets to a point where the world is all explored and most people have reached end game it can be hard to keep everyone interested in playing. Motivation runs dry and and many players will get bored, stop playing, and move on to a new server for a fresh experience.\
\
In our years of maintaining the server, we've found that a seasonal approach to content and gameplay has been incredibly effective in maintaining and keeping the community we all love alive and prosperous. Seasons keep the server fresh, interesting, and makes sure as many people as possible can enjoy the server for a long time across multiple worlds, instead of just on one world.\
\
We always give ample notice before a new season begins. We will make frequent announcements on our [discord ](https://site.vibecentral.xyz/dc)and in-game to ensure everybody is updated and aware when a new season is on it's way. We will never suddenly implement a new season without giving over 2 weeks notice.

## **How can I save my work?**

* Through use of mods like Litematica, you can save small sections of the world into a singleplayer creative or survival world. Litematica requires Fabric, a mod loader. We also release the world seed to allow you to generate the same terrain and paste your builds in the same part of the copied singleplayer world.\

* If you're unable to get Litematica working, we are happy to create .schematic files of your work for you. Schematic files are a kind of file that can store MC build data, and are widely supported among lots of Minecraft related mods & software. With these files, you can store and import them to your worlds using various mods and software like AmuletMC, WorldEdit or Litematica.\

* Additionally, if builds are small enough, we may consider allowing you to copy and paste them into the [creative plotworld](broken-reference) using our server side [WorldEdit](../../general/misc./worldedit.md).

## **Can't we just keep the same world?**

We understand that the impermanence of the world can be upsetting and demotivating, though unfortunately, as a public survival server we can't confidently sustain an engaged and growing community without new seasons. We hope you can take inspiration from all the memories and journeys you have throughout smp seasons to try and experience new things and ultimately enjoy your experience to the fullest extent throughout a long period of time.\
\
We also provide options to save your work and continue your survival in a single player world. See the section above for more information.

## **Will there be a world download?**

Due to the sheer file size of the world hitting over 100GB, and for respect for players privacy, we do not provide public downloads for the entire world.\
\
We do provide options to save your work and continue your survival in a single player world. See the section above for more information.

## **How will I know when the next season is coming?**

We always give notice before a new season begins, and will make announcements on our[ Discord ](../../general/discord.md)and in-game to ensure everybody is updated and aware when a new season is on its way.

## D**oes the world seed change?**

Yep! new seasons worlds are freshly generated, opening up an entire unexplored world to everybody.

## W**ill there be a season recap?**

Per server tradition, at the end of seasons, we release a special recap page will be available for you to view. The page shows lots of nifty and fun stats from the season, like total hours played by all players, total blocks placed/broken, and more! The page will be announced in our [Discord](../../general/discord.md) server shortly after seasons end.\
