# Party Games

Ever looking for a fun break from survival? We offer a custom-made minigame suite featuring 19 fast paced minigames to play casually any time! The games needs a minimum of 3 players to start, and can hold up to a maximum of 10 players. Each round of party games consists of a random queue of 8 out of the 19 minigames. The system will only repeat already played games when it runs out of unplayed ones, giving each queue a fresh and exciting feel.\
\
Players earn party game points called Stars by placing 1st (+3), 2nd (+2), or 3rd (+1) in minigames. At the end of the queue, the top 3 players with the most Stars win!
