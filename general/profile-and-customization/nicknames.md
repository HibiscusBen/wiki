# Nicknames

Nicknames allow you to change your display name on the server. They appear anywhere your username would appear while you're online. Nicknames must be between 3-14 characters and can be changed at max once every 7 days.

Your nickname must be a real nickname you associate with, containing no strong language or references to sensitive or offensive topics, and abides by the [server rules](../community-guidelines.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
In the tablist, your real username will be right-aligned for players reference. Players may also use the **`/realname <nickname>`** command to view the username behind a nickname.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
