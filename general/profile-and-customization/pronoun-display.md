# Pronoun display

Set your preferred pronouns so others can easily see how to refer to you. Your pronouns are displayed by[ hovering usernames in chat](../rich-chat/), and by using the **`/pronouns <name>`** command.

You can freely change or remove your pronouns at any time, however some pronouns not on our list of most used pronouns may need staff approval before being applied to ensure the feature is not being misused.
